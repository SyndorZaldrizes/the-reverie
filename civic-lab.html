          The Civic Lab is where the theory leaves the PDF. It’s a mix of consulting, workshops,
          and game‑style activities for student governments, clubs, classes, and youth projects
          that want to actually do democracy—not just talk about it.

          <div class="card">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Student governments &amp; MSL delegations:</strong> Need bylaws that
                actually work, not just copy‑paste from a random template.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clubs &amp; campus orgs:</strong> Want meetings that aren’t chaos and
                participation that isn’t just the same three people.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Educators &amp; staff:</strong> Want plug‑and‑play activities that teach
                democratic skills without turning every class into a full simulation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Youth projects &amp; future delegates:</strong> Want missions and games
                that make civic life feel like something you can actually touch.

            </ul>
            <p class="small">
              All work is <strong>nonpartisan</strong> and focused on democratic skills, structures,

        <!-- GAME-STYLE ACTIVITIES -->
        <section>
          <h2>Drop‑In Civic Lab Activities (Game‑Style)</h2>
          <p>
            These are structured activities you can run in 30–60 minutes. Think “lesson plan,” but
            with slightly more chaos and a lot more agency.
          </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>1. Agenda Jenga</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Learn agenda‑setting and priorities without a three‑hour meeting.</p>
            <p><strong>You’ll need:</strong> Index cards or sticky notes, a whiteboard or wall.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Everyone writes one real issue on a card (campus, club, community).</li>
              <li>Cards go on the board. As a group, you can only keep <strong>five</strong>.</li>
              <li>
                One person plays “chair” and leads a fast debate: what stays, what gets dropped,
                and why?
              </li>
              <li>Debrief: Who got heard? What issues dropped off first? Why?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              <strong>Good for:</strong> Student gov retreats, club officer trainings, youth
              leadership programs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>2. Budget Lab: Slice the Pie</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Practice trade‑offs and coalition‑building.</p>
            <p><strong>You’ll need:</strong> A fake budget (or your real one), categories, markers.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Give groups a simple “budget pie”: e.g., 100 points to divide among 6 categories.</li>
              <li>Each group must create a budget and justify it in 2–3 bullet points.</li>
              <li>Groups present; then a second round happens after hearing others’ arguments.</li>
              <li>
                Compare Round 1 vs Round 2: What shifted? Did anyone change their mind? What
                arguments moved people?
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              <strong>Good for:</strong> SGA/club funding discussions, civic classes, MSL training.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Parli Pro Speedrun</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Make parliamentary procedure less terrifying and more like a co‑op game.</p>
            <p><strong>You’ll need:</strong> A short cheat sheet of motions and a silly sample issue.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Pick a low‑stakes topic (snacks budget, club trip, theme for an event).</li>
              <li>
                Assign roles: chair, clerk, timekeeper, 4–6 members. Everyone gets a quick motions
                cheat sheet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Run a <strong>10–15 minute</strong> mock meeting where the only goal is: use at
                least 3 different motions correctly (e.g., move to amend, move to table, call the
                question).
              </li>
              <li>Debrief: What felt empowering? What felt confusing or gatekeeping‑ish?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              <strong>Good for:</strong> MSL prep, student government training, intro to Robert’s Rules.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>4. Spectacle vs Substance</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Train students to separate political “show” from real decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>You’ll need:</strong> A few screenshots or clips of political content (TV, social, campus emails).</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Show a clip or read a short excerpt.</li>
              <li>Ask: “What’s the actual decision here, if any?” Write it down.</li>
              <li>Ask: “Who decides? Where? When?” Map it onto local/state/national or campus.</li>
              <li>Brainstorm one concrete action a student could take that relates to the real decision.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              <strong>Good for:</strong> Youth workshops, media literacy sessions, first‑year seminars.

        <!-- AI HELPERS -->
        <section>
          <h2>AI Helpers for Civic Work (Used Safely)</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              AI is not a replacement for real civic work, but it can be a surprisingly useful
              assistant if you tell it exactly what you want and force it to show its sources.
              The Civic Lab uses AI in a few focused ways:
            </p>

            <h3>Ask the Assembly (Maryland Legislative Help)</h3>
            <p>
              You can use an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) alongside the official Maryland General
              Assembly resources to get plain‑language explanations. A safe pattern:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Go to the <strong>Maryland General Assembly</strong> website and find the relevant
                page (e.g., “How a Bill Becomes Law,” rules, committee info).
              </li>
              <li>
                Copy the relevant text or link and paste it into your AI chat with a prompt like:
                <br />
                <em>
                  “Using only this official Maryland General Assembly material, explain in simple
                  terms how a bill moves from introduction to becoming law. Flag any steps that are
                  unique to Maryland.”
                </em>
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask follow‑up questions, but always cross‑check with the official site before using
                the answer in anything formal.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              <strong>Rule:</strong> AI helps you understand; the <em>Assembly</em> is still the
              authority.
            </p>

            <h3>Bylaw Builder &amp; Rule Rewrite</h3>
            <p>
              For clubs and delegations, AI can help refactor messy documents if you keep it on a
              tight leash:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Paste your constitution/bylaws into a document.</li>
              <li>
                Ask an AI: <em>
                  “Rewrite this into a clear, student‑friendly bylaws document, but do not change
                  any powers or voting thresholds. Just clarify and reorganize.”
                </em>
              </li>
              <li>Review the output line by line before adopting anything.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Agenda &amp; Email Draft Assist</h3>
            <p>
              You can also use AI to generate sample agendas, recruitment emails, and training
              outlines. The Lab can help you design the prompts so you get useful drafts instead of
              generic spam.
            </p>

            <p class="small">
              <strong>Note:</strong> A future version of this site may include a dedicated “Civic
              Lab Assistant” that sits on top of official manuals and this project’s research.
              For now, the Lab offers guidance on <em>how</em> to use AI well; the tools you use
              (ChatGPT, etc.) are up to you and your institution’s policies.
