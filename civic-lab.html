        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p><strong>Is this partisan?</strong> No. The Civic Lab focuses on
            developing democratic skills and structures rather than advocating
            for any particular party or ideology.</p>
          <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> Student governments, issue‑based
            clubs, departments and smaller institutions looking to build or
            reinvigorate their civic programs.</p>
          <p><strong>Why does it cost money?</strong> Providing high‑quality
            consulting and resources takes time and expertise. Your support helps
            Nathan continue his studies and expand democratic programming.</p>
