                This page presents a polished journal memo that lays the groundwork for my senior dissertation on
                democracy and civic engagement. It synthesizes key literature, proposes a research question, and
                outlines the methodological approach. The focus here is on how people <em>learn</em> democracy in
                practice, touching on issues of democratic erosion and social trends in civic behavior.

            <section id="introduction" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Democratic erosion has become a defining concern of our era. While many studies examine institutions
                and elites, this proposal argues that the roots of democratic resilience or decay lie in everyday
                civic learning and engagement among citizens. In recent years, scholars have noted worrying trends:
                younger generations are increasingly dissatisfied with how democracy is working, and factors like
                polarization and declining trust in institutions are identified as drivers of democratic erosion.
                However, there is also evidence that meaningful civic experiences can counter these trends.
              </p>
              <p>
                This proposal suggests that by understanding <em>how</em> people learn about democracy—especially in
                formative years and through civic organizations—we can better explain why some communities defend
                democratic norms while others become disengaged.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="rq" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Research Question</h2>
              <p>The central question guiding this study is:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    How do individuals’ early experiences with civic and political participation—particularly in educational
                    and organizational settings—shape their commitment to democratic norms and engagement later in life?
                  </strong>
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In other words, can we trace a link between the ways young people encounter politics (through family discussions,
                schools, social organizations, or programs like the Maryland Student Legislature) and their willingness as adults
                to uphold democratic principles amid social and political pressures?
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="framework" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>
              <p>
                This project draws on several bodies of literature. <strong>First</strong>, from normative democratic theory,
                Hannah Arendt’s distinction between the public realm of freedom and the private realm of necessity underscores
                that true political freedom is experienced through active participation in a public world. <strong>Second</strong>,
                civic education and political socialization research shows that habits formed early—in families, schools, or youth
                organizations—can have lasting effects on political engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Third</strong>, critical perspectives remind us that not everyone is invited equally into the democratic
                process. Charles Mills argues liberal democracy often operated as an exclusive club shaped by race and class power.
                Elizabeth Cohen’s work on semi-citizenship similarly suggests many individuals hold only partial inclusion in civic
                life. <strong>Finally</strong>, contemporary scholarship on democratic erosion emphasizes polarization and institutional
                distrust as forces that corrode democratic norms.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="lit" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Literature Review and Related Studies</h2>
              <p>
                A growing literature explores how civic organizations and educational settings can foster democratic engagement.
                Classic work highlights how associations build social capital and civic skills. Recent studies focus on youth:
                structured programs (service learning, student government) can instill political efficacy and habits of participation.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also evidence that <em>how</em> participation is framed matters. Bennion and Nickerson find that a simple
                classroom voter registration presentation boosted student participation measures, and face-to-face mobilization can
                further increase turnout in campus contexts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps most importantly for this proposal, Hertel-Fernandez shows that civic organizations can engage members who
                are politically at odds with the group’s usual stance by fostering a strong internal culture of participation—shared
                identity + expected norms—bridging ideological divides rather than worsening them.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="methods" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                I propose a mixed-methods study, beginning with an exploratory qualitative phase and followed by a quantitative
                survey experiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Phase 1:</strong> Semi-structured interviews with college students who have participated in immersive civic
                programs and those who have not, focused on first encounters with civic/political activities and perceived value formation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Phase 2:</strong> A campus-based survey experiment with randomized message frames:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Neutral message (control):</em> basic info on registering / joining a campus voter drive.</li>
                <li><em>Conflict frame message:</em> emphasizes national partisan conflict.</li>
                <li><em>Inclusive frame message:</em> shared campus identity + local issues.</li>
                <li><em>Inclusive + Norms message:</em> inclusive framing + descriptive norm (“most students do this”).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Outcomes include political efficacy, trust, intent to vote, and a behavioral measure (e.g., sign-up for a non-partisan
                civic event). Models will estimate treatment effects and interaction terms for cross-pressured students.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="contrib" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Expected Contributions</h2>
              <p>
                Theoretically, the project links micro-level civic learning to macro-level democratic stability, arguing that democratic
                resilience is learned and practiced, not merely inherited. Practically, results could inform educators and organizers on
                which frames and program designs pull in otherwise alienated young people.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="conclusion" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                Democracy is not self-sustaining; it relies on citizens continually renewing commitment to its norms. This proposal outlines
                a plan to examine one crucial factor in that renewal: formative experiences that teach people what democracy is and why it matters.
                By studying young adults in a campus setting, we can test how inclusive practices might reconnect disaffected citizens to democratic life.
              </p>
