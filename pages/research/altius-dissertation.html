              ALTIUS is an agency-first AI task engine prototype designed to reduce inertia and convert intent into
              follow-through. Unlike “answer machines,” ALTIUS is framed as a structured co-agent that prioritizes
              user ownership, next-step clarity, and ethical constraints (nonpartisan, non-therapeutic, data-minimal).
            </p>
            <p>
              This write-up formalizes ALTIUS as a parallel dissertation thread: (1) a civic learning tool, and (2) a
              human–AI interaction study that can generate anonymized process measures of task initiation and completion.

        <section id="problem">
          <h2>1. The Problem: Civic Concern Without Civic Follow-Through</h2>
          <p>
            Many students experience civic and academic life as a constant stream of high-level obligations:
            “I should vote,” “I should show up,” “I should write the paper,” “I should email the committee.”
            The failure mode is often not ignorance. It is friction: overload, ambiguity, social risk, and the
            psychology of avoidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The practical result is a predictable cycle: the student understands what matters, but stalls at the first
            step—then shame compounds the stall. This is relevant not only to grades but to democracy: sustained civic
            engagement depends on repeatable habits of initiation, coordination, and follow-through.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Theory of Change: Agency as a Repeatable Loop</h2>
          <p>
            ALTIUS is built around an operational definition of agency: the capacity to reliably translate intention into
            action under real constraints (time, uncertainty, anxiety, competing demands).
          </p>
          <p>
            The intervention is not “motivation.” It is structure: a short interaction loop that forces clarity,
            decomposes work, anchors a minimal next step, and then iterates through completion.
          </p>

          <h3>3.1 Design constraints (hard rules)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Agency-first:</strong> the user chooses goals; the system scaffolds execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Nonpartisan:</strong> no recommendation toward any party or candidate outcomes.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Local model (future track):</strong> more autonomy and customization, but significantly more engineering,

              Training a new LLM from scratch is usually unrealistic for a student project. If you ever go local, the sane path is:
              use an existing open model + carefully scoped fine-tuning (or retrieval) + strict evaluation. But the dissertation value
              doesn’t depend on owning the model — it depends on the theory, protocol, and measurable outcomes.

              ALTIUS can be a substudy nested inside the campus framing/norms experiment:
              after the survey, students who opt in can use ALTIUS to complete a civic micro-task
              (e.g., drafting one email, signing up for one event, planning one meeting).
              This links framing effects to real follow-through behavior.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> did the participant start within 24 hours? (yes/no)</li>
            <li><strong>Completion:</strong> completed within study window? (yes/no)</li>
            <li><strong>Time-to-start:</strong> hours between intention and first action</li>
            <li><strong>Next-step adherence:</strong> did they follow the anchored step (yes/no)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6.2 Secondary outcomes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-efficacy:</strong> “I can influence outcomes here” (campus-specific)</li>
            <li><strong>Agency perception:</strong> “I’m steering; the tool is supporting”</li>
            <li><strong>Over-reliance risk:</strong> indicators of deferring decisions to the system</li>

          <h3>6.3 Minimal data principle</h3>
          <p class="footnote">
            If you collect any logs, store only what you need (task category + timestamp + completion state), and avoid
            personal narrative content. If you don’t need logs, don’t create them.

          <p>
            ALTIUS is designed to be low-risk by design. Still, the ethics need to be explicit, because AI tools can
            accidentally become manipulative, partisan, or dependency-forming if left unchecked.

            These are designed to be model-agnostic. You can run them manually (in a chat) or embed them later.
            The important thing is consistency: same structure across participants.
          </p>

          <h3>A1. Intake prompt (Clarify)</h3>
          <pre><code>ALTIUS INTAKE — RULES
You are a task engine. You do not make decisions for me.
You do not write full assignments that should be mine.
You produce: clarity, a plan, and the smallest next action.

TASK:
- What task am I avoiding?
- What's the real deliverable (file/email/meeting outcome)?
- What's the deadline (or "none")?
- Why is this hard (1–2 sentences)?
- What resources do I already have (notes, links, docs)?</code></pre>

          <h3>A2. Decomposition prompt (Decompose + Anchor)</h3>
          <pre><code>DECOMPOSE THIS TASK
1) List atomic steps (10–15 max).
2) Label each as DECISION work or MECHANICAL work.
3) Identify the smallest non-zero action I can do in 5 minutes.
4) Give me a 25-minute sprint plan (3–5 steps only).
5) End by asking me to choose: 5 minutes or 25 minutes.</code></pre>

          <h3>A3. Execution + reflection prompt (Execute &amp; Reflect)</h3>
          <pre><code>EXECUTION CHECK
Ask me what I completed.
If I didn't do it, diagnose friction (time/clarity/anxiety/boredom/overwhelm).
Then:
- shrink the next step,
- time-box it,
- and have me commit to a single action I can finish now.</code></pre>

          <h3>A4. Civic-safe mode (nonpartisan, action-forward)</h3>
          <pre><code>CIVIC SAFE MODE
When the task is civic or political:
- stay nonpartisan,
- focus on democratic skills (participation, deliberation, outreach),
- prefer local/institutional actions (campus/community),
- and require me to choose the action.</code></pre>

          <p class="footnote">
            If you want, we can add an Appendix B with consent/debrief boilerplate specifically for IRB-style formatting.
