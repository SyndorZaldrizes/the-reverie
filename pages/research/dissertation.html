              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Democratic engagement among young adults is widely viewed as both a chronic problem and a crucial site
                of opportunity. Concerns about low youth turnout, uneven participation, and growing distrust of
                political institutions have generated a large literature on youth civic and political engagement. At the
                same time, young people increasingly encounter politics through campuses, workplaces, and digital
                communities that are themselves structured by organizations and norms. Yet much of the empirical work on
                student participation remains focused on informational and procedural barriers—how to register students,
                how to reduce transaction costs—rather than on how organizational cultures shape engagement, especially
                for those who do not comfortably fit dominant political identities.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project starts from a different premise: that democratic engagement is not just an individual trait
                or a function of partisan mobilization, but a relational outcome produced by the civic organizations
                people inhabit. Following Hertel-Fernandez’s work on unions and cross-pressured members, I argue that
                organizations can foster participation among politically ambivalent or ideologically misaligned
                individuals when they cultivate inclusive norms of participation, frame engagement around shared
                non-partisan identities, and emphasize local stakes rather than distant partisan conflict. A college
                campus, with its dense web of student organizations, civic programs, and administrative initiatives, is
                an ideal setting to test these ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The long-run goal is a multi-campus, multi-method research agenda that could plausibly grow into a
                dissertation project. As a first step, this paper develops the theoretical framework and proposes a
                campus-based pilot experiment on democratic engagement among college students, designed to generate
                evidence for or against the value of scaling the study to a larger number of institutions.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="framework" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Theoretical Framework: Civic Organizations and Cross-Pressured Members</h2>
              <p>
                Classic work on civic associations emphasizes their role in fostering political skills, social networks,
                and opportunities for collective action. Contemporary research has extended this tradition, showing that
                youth organizations and structured group experiences promote civic and political engagement by offering
                meaningful opportunities for participation and socialization into democratic norms. Parallel literatures
                on framing and political communication emphasize that how issues and participation are framed shapes not
                only opinions but also political behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hertel-Fernandez contributes to this conversation by focusing on “cross-pressured” individuals—members
                whose ideological or partisan preferences do not fully align with their organization’s political
                activities. In a study of a teachers’ union in a right-to-work state, he shows that local leaders who
                build strong “cultures of participation” can engage conservative members in union political activities
                despite ideological disagreement. These leaders frame political action through shared occupational
                identity (as educators), focus on local issues (such as school funding and working conditions), and
                cultivate norms that participation is a core expectation of membership. Under these conditions,
                conservative members report stronger perceptions of representation and higher levels of political
                engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                This perspective challenges more pessimistic views that cross-cutting organizations will demobilize
                members who disagree with some of their positions. Instead, it suggests that organizational design—how
                leaders talk about politics, whose identities are centered, what norms are emphasized—can help bridge
                ideological divides.

              <h2>Campus-Based Civic Engagement: What We Know and What We Do Not</h2>
              <p>
                On college campuses, a parallel literature has focused mainly on voter registration and turnout.
                Bennion and Nickerson’s multi-campus field experiment in college classrooms shows that even relatively
                simple, classroom-based voter registration presentations can increase student registration and turnout.
                Hill and Lachelier find that face-to-face mobilization efforts can boost student turnout in campus
                contexts, reinforcing the idea that personal contact matters. More recently, work on nationwide efforts
                to promote student voter registration (e.g., Ask Every Student and related programs) documents positive
                associations between exposure to campus registration efforts and reported registration and turnout,
                especially among first-year students.
              </p>
              <p>
                This body of work demonstrates that colleges and universities can, under the right conditions, move
                student participation. However, several limitations remain. First, most studies focus on administrative
                or procedural interventions: distributing forms in class, sending emails, coordinating tabling, or
                simplifying access to online registration. Second, the dominant outcomes are registration and turnout,
                which are important but do not fully capture broader democratic engagement, such as participation in
                deliberative forums, campus governance, or issue-based organizing. Third, little attention has been paid
                to the experiences of cross-pressured or politically “out-of-place” students: those whose ideological
                views or social identities do not match the visible political climate of their campus, and who may be
                especially wary of overtly partisan appeals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bridging these literatures suggests a new question: can campus organizations and civic programs borrow
                strategies from union contexts to foster inclusive cultures of participation that bring politically
                diverse students, including cross-pressured ones, more fully into democratic life?
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="rq" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Research Question and Core Claims</h2>
              <p>The central research question is:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  How do organizational communication frames and participatory norms shape democratic engagement among
                  college students, especially those who experience political cross-pressure or perceive themselves as
                  misaligned with the campus political climate?
                </p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The core claims are as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Framing claim:</strong> Messages that frame civic engagement in terms of shared campus identity
                  and local stakes will be more effective at promoting democratic engagement than neutral administrative
                  messages or messages emphasizing national partisan conflict.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Norms claim:</strong> Messages that explicitly highlight strong descriptive norms of
                  participation (“students here typically participate in…”) will increase engagement by signaling that
                  civic participation is expected and socially supported.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-pressure claim:</strong> These effects will be particularly pronounced for
                  cross-pressured students—those who report ideological or partisan views that differ from what they
                  perceive as the dominant campus political orientation, or who feel uncomfortable with visible campus
                  activism.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="pilot" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>The Campus Pilot Experiment</h2>
              <p>
                To test these claims, I propose a survey experiment embedded in a campus-wide online study of student
                civic and political engagement.
              </p>

              <h3>Population and Sampling</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Announcements in introductory political science and general education courses.</li>
                <li>Campus-wide email invitations.</li>
                <li>Outreach through student government and selected, non-partisan student organizations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The target sample size is approximately 150–250 respondents, sufficient for detecting moderate treatment
                effects and, more importantly, for generating effect-size estimates for future power analyses.
              </p>

              <h3>Measures</h3>
              <p>The survey will measure:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Demographic and background variables:</strong> year, major, race/ethnicity, gender, first-gen status, residence.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Political identity and cross-pressure:</strong>
                  ideology, partisanship, perceived campus climate, and misfit/discomfort items.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Democratic engagement outcomes:</strong>
                  voting likelihood; willingness to participate in campus civic activities; campus-tailored efficacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Behavioral outcomes:</strong>
                  real opt-in opportunities (mailing list signup, event interest) to complement self-reports.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Experimental Treatments</h3>
              <p>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four message conditions:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Neutral control:</strong> generic campus resources/events.</li>
                <li><strong>Partisan conflict frame:</strong> national polarization / “fight for your side.”</li>
                <li><strong>Identity + local stakes frame:</strong> campus community identity + local decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity + local stakes + norms frame:</strong> adds descriptive norms emphasizing participation as ordinary/expected.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Analytical Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                Estimate average treatment effects on attitudinal and behavioral outcomes using regression models. Test
                cross-pressure moderation with interactions between treatment indicators and cross-pressure measures.
              </p>

              <h3>Why this pilot matters</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Feasibility test: recruitment + randomization.</li>
                <li>Measurement test: cross-pressure and perceived misfit items.</li>
                <li>Effect-size estimates for a multi-campus power analysis.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="scaling" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Scaling Up: Toward a Multi-Campus Dissertation Project</h2>
              <p>
                Building on the pilot, the research can be scaled into a dissertation-level project in at least two ways.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Multi-campus field experiment:</strong> embed framing/norms manipulations into real outreach
                  across institution types; measure actual participation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Qualitative components:</strong> interviews with organizers; focus groups with cross-pressured
                  students to understand how civic culture signals are constructed and interpreted.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="conclusion" style="margin-top: 16px;">
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                Existing research demonstrates that youth civic engagement is malleable and that educational and
                organizational interventions can meaningfully affect participation. Work on unions suggests that
                cross-pressured individuals are not doomed to disengagement; under the right organizational conditions,
                they can be drawn into political life through norms of participation, identity-based framing, and locally
                grounded appeals.
              </p>
              <p>
                By treating the college campus as a laboratory of democracy, this project tests whether similar
                strategies can foster engagement among politically diverse students, including those who feel out of
                place in dominant campus political climates. The proposed pilot experiment is a first step: a structured,
                empirically grounded test of how frames and norms shape engagement—and a gateway to a multi-campus
                dissertation if results justify scaling.
