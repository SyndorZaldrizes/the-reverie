        <h2>Research Questions &amp; Hypotheses</h2>
        <p>
          This experiment asks how universities can cultivate a culture of democratic
          engagement that reaches all students, including those who feel politically out
          of place. We draw on recent political science research showing that civic
          organizations can mobilize “cross‑pressured” members by emphasizing shared
          identity, local stakes, and norms of participation. Our core hypotheses are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>H1 (Framing):</strong> Messages that frame civic engagement around shared
            campus identity and local issues will increase students’ sense of
            representation and willingness to participate.</li>
          <li><strong>H2 (Norms):</strong> Messages that highlight descriptive norms — that most
            students participate in some form of civic activity — will boost
            engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>H3 (Cross‑pressure moderation):</strong> These effects will be strongest for
            students who perceive themselves as politically misaligned with the campus
            climate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experimental Treatments</h2>
        <p>
          In the pilot study, participants will be randomly assigned to read one of four
          short messages delivered via an online survey. Each message frames civic
          engagement differently: (1) a neutral control message, (2) a partisan
          conflict frame that emphasizes national polarization, (3) a campus identity
          frame that ties engagement to being a responsible member of the campus
          community, and (4) an identity + norms frame that combines the campus frame
          with descriptive norms about student participation. After reading the
          message, students answer questions about political efficacy, campus
          representation and intentions to participate in civic activities. They are
          also offered a real opportunity to sign up for more information or future
          events.

        <h2>Ethics &amp; Participation</h2>
        <p>
          The study has been reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board.
          Participation is voluntary, anonymous and confidential. Survey data will be
          analyzed in aggregate to protect individual privacy. If you decide not to
          participate, there will be no penalties or consequences. Participants may
          withdraw at any time without penalty.
        </p>

          participant, please contact the principal investigator at
