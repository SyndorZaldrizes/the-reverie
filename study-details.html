          <!-- RESEARCH QUESTIONS & HYPOTHESES -->
          <section>
            <h2>Research Questions &amp; Hypotheses</h2>
            <p>
              The study asks how universities can cultivate a culture of democratic engagement that
              reaches all students, including those who feel politically out of place. Drawing on
              work on civic organizations and “cross-pressured” members, the central claim is that
              organizational communication and norms can either widen or close the gap between
              politically comfortable and politically misaligned students.
            </p>

            <p>The main research question is:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                How do different ways of framing campus civic engagement, combined with norms about
                participation, shape democratic engagement among college students—especially those
                who perceive themselves as politically misaligned with the campus climate?
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>From this, we derive three core hypotheses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>H1 (Framing):</strong> Messages that frame civic engagement around shared
                campus identity and local issues will increase students’ sense of representation and
                willingness to participate, relative to a neutral control and a national partisan
                conflict frame.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>H2 (Norms):</strong> Messages that highlight descriptive norms—that many
                students participate in some form of civic activity—will further boost engagement by
                signaling that participation is expected and socially supported.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>H3 (Cross-pressure moderation):</strong> The positive effects of identity-
                and norm-based frames will be strongest for students who perceive themselves as
                politically misaligned with the campus climate (“cross-pressured” students).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <!-- DESIGN OVERVIEW -->
          <section>
            <h2>Design Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The project uses a mixed-methods approach anchored by a campus-based survey experiment.
              The design has two linked goals:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Substantive:</strong> Test whether framing and norms can move key outcomes
                like political efficacy, perceived campus representation, and willingness to engage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design/developmental:</strong> Generate effect-size estimates, refine
                measures, and identify implementation challenges in preparation for a larger,
                multi-campus study.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The pilot experiment is embedded in an online survey administered to students at a
              liberal arts college. Participants are randomly assigned to one of four short messages
              about campus civic engagement (described below), then answer questions and face a real,
              low-stakes opportunity to engage.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- POPULATION & SAMPLING -->
          <section>
            <h2>Population &amp; Sampling</h2>
            <p>
              The immediate population of interest is undergraduate students enrolled at a small,
              liberal arts college. In practice, the pilot draws on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Students in introductory political science and general education courses.</li>
              <li>Students reached through a campus-wide email invitation.</li>
              <li>
                Students contacted via student government, civic organizations, and relevant
                non-partisan clubs (e.g., service, debate, MSL delegation).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The target sample size for the pilot is approximately <strong>150–250</strong>
              respondents. This is sufficient to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Detect moderate treatment effects on attitudinal outcomes with basic regression
                models.
              </li>
              <li>
                Produce preliminary effect-size estimates for interaction effects (treatment ×
                cross-pressure) to inform subsequent power analyses.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Participation is voluntary; students may opt in via survey links distributed through
              classes, email, and organization channels. No single class is required to participate,
              and participation is not tied to course grades.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- MEASURES -->
          <section>
            <h2>Key Measures</h2>
            <p>
              The survey instrument is designed to capture both demographic/background variables and
              theoretically important constructs. The full item wording appears on the
              <a href="questionnaires.html">Questionnaires</a> page; here we summarize the main
              indices.
            </p>

            <h3>Background &amp; Demographics</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Year in school, major/minor, residence (on/off campus).</li>
              <li>Race/ethnicity, gender, first-generation college status.</li>
              <li>Past political behavior (voting where eligible, campaign activities, etc.).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Political Identity &amp; Cross-Pressure</h3>
            <p>
              To operationalize cross-pressure and perceived misfit, the study uses several
              components:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ideology:</strong> Self-placement on a standard liberal–conservative
                7-point scale.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Partisanship:</strong> Party identification with leaner categories and
                options for non-identifiers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Perceived campus climate:</strong> Items asking how students perceive “the
                typical politically active student” (e.g., “On this campus, most politically engaged
                students are…”).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Misfit/cross-pressure index:</strong> Items such as “I feel out of place
                when politics is discussed on this campus” and “I rarely see my views represented in
                campus political conversations,” combined into a scale.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Democratic Engagement Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Key attitudinal outcomes include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Internal political efficacy (campus-specific):</strong> e.g.,
                “People like me can influence decisions at this college.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>External efficacy/trust:</strong> e.g., “Campus decision-makers take student
                input seriously.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Engagement intentions:</strong> self-reported likelihood of voting in the
                next election (where eligible) and participating in campus forums, town halls, or
                issue campaigns.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Behavioral outcomes are captured through:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A real option to <strong>sign up</strong> for a non-partisan civic mailing list or
                indicate interest in a campus civic event.
              </li>
              <li>
                Click-through and sign-up rates, recorded separately from survey responses to
                protect anonymity where required.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <!-- EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS -->
          <section>
            <h2>Experimental Treatments</h2>
            <p>
              In the pilot study, participants are randomly assigned to read one of four short
              messages delivered via the online survey. Each message is written in the voice of a
              campus office or organization and framed to be realistic but brief. The content mirrors
              the messages documented more fully on the <a href="dissertation.html">Dissertation</a>
              page.
            </p>

            <h3>Condition 1: Neutral Control</h3>
            <p>
              A short informational message about campus resources and upcoming opportunities (e.g.,
              tutoring, wellness, student organizations). It makes no explicit appeal to civic
              engagement and includes no political or normative language. This condition establishes
              a baseline for simply receiving a benign campus communication.
            </p>

            <h3>Condition 2: Partisan Conflict Frame</h3>
            <p>
              A message emphasizing national-level partisan conflict and polarization. It frames
              student civic engagement in terms of “fighting for your side” in a high-stakes national
              struggle. This mirrors the kind of conflict-oriented messaging students often see in
              national media and on social platforms.
            </p>

            <h3>Condition 3: Campus Identity &amp; Local Stakes Frame</h3>
            <p>
              A message that minimizes national partisan conflict and instead frames engagement as a
              core part of being a responsible member of the campus community. It highlights local
              stakes: student services, campus funding decisions, housing, mental health resources,
              and other issues directly affecting student life. The message stresses shared identity
              (“as [College Name] students”) rather than ideological labels.
            </p>

            <h3>Condition 4: Identity + Norms Frame</h3>
            <p>
              This message builds on Condition 3 but adds explicit descriptive norms. It notes that
              many students participate in at least one civic activity, attend events, or provide
              feedback each semester, signaling that engagement is typical rather than exceptional.
              The goal is to test whether combining identity and local-stakes framing with descriptive
              norms produces stronger effects on attitudes and behavior.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- ANALYTIC STRATEGY -->
          <section>
            <h2>Analytic Strategy</h2>
            <p>
              The analysis proceeds in several steps, reflecting basic causal inference logic covered
              in POSC 200–level methodology but applied with dissertation-level care.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Balance &amp; Randomization Checks</h3>
            <p>
              Before estimating treatment effects, the study checks whether random assignment
              produced comparable groups. Descriptive statistics and simple balance tests (e.g.,
              comparing means of key covariates across treatment arms) are used to verify that
              ideology, cross-pressure scores, and major demographic variables are not systematically
              skewed.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Main Treatment Effects</h3>
            <p>
              For continuous attitudinal outcomes (e.g., efficacy scales), the primary estimators are
              ordinary least squares (OLS) models of the form:
            </p>
            <pre><code>Yᵢ = β₀ + β₁T₂ᵢ + β₂T₃ᵢ + β₃T₄ᵢ + Xᵢγ + εᵢ</code></pre>
            <p>
              where <em>T₂–T₄</em> are dummy variables for the partisan, identity, and
              identity+norms conditions (with the control as the omitted category) and <em>Xᵢ</em>
              captures pre-treatment covariates (e.g., ideology, year in school) included to improve
              precision. For binary outcomes (e.g., whether a student signs up for an event),
              logistic regression or linear probability models are used, with robustness checks for
              specification.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Cross-Pressure Interactions</h3>
            <p>
              To test H3, models include interaction terms between the treatment indicators and the
              cross-pressure index:
            </p>
            <pre><code>Yᵢ = β₀ + β₁T₂ᵢ + β₂T₃ᵢ + β₃T₄ᵢ
      + β₄CrossPressureᵢ
      + β₅(T₃ᵢ × CrossPressureᵢ)
      + β₆(T₄ᵢ × CrossPressureᵢ)
      + Xᵢγ + εᵢ</code></pre>
            <p>
              Substantive interpretation focuses on <em>marginal effects</em> of frames at different
              levels of cross-pressure (e.g., low, medium, high), rather than on raw interaction
              coefficients alone. Graphical displays (predicted values and confidence intervals) are
              used to communicate the results.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Pilot Orientation</h3>
            <p>
              Because this is a pilot, the emphasis is on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reasonable effect-size estimates with uncertainty clearly reported.</li>
              <li>Sensitivity checks (e.g., excluding inattentive respondents, alternative codings).</li>
              <li>
                Identifying where measures or procedures need refinement before a multi-campus scale
                up.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The study explicitly avoids over-claiming “definitive” results from a single-campus
              pilot; instead, it treats findings as evidence that can either justify scaling up or
              push a redesign.

          <!-- IMPLEMENTATION & LIMITATIONS -->
          <section>
            <h2>Implementation Notes &amp; Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              The design acknowledges several practical and theoretical limitations up front:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Single-campus context:</strong> Findings may be shaped by the specific
                political climate, size, and culture of the institution. A full dissertation project
                would need a multi-campus design to test generalizability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-selection into the survey:</strong> Students willing to participate may
                already be more civically interested than the average student. Descriptive statistics
                and comparisons with campus-wide demographics will be used to assess representativeness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Short-term measurement:</strong> The pilot focuses on immediate attitudinal
                shifts and near-term behavioral intentions. Longer-term effects (e.g., actual turnout
                in a future election) would require panel data or administrative linkages.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These limitations are not fatal; they simply clarify what this phase of the project can
              and cannot prove. The study is designed as a serious first step in a longer, iterative
              research program rather than as a one-off “gotcha” experiment.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- ETHICS -->
          <section>
            <h2>Ethics, Consent, &amp; Data Protection</h2>
            <p>
              Any real-world implementation of this study on a campus will be submitted for review by
              the institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) or equivalent ethics committee
              before data collection begins. The design follows standard principles of research
              ethics in political science and related fields:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Voluntary participation:</strong> Students choose whether to participate.
                There are no penalties for non-participation, and course-related incentives (if any)
                must be approved and proportionate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Informed consent:</strong> The survey begins with a clear explanation of the
                study’s purpose, what participation involves, potential risks (which are minimal),
                and how data will be used. Participants must affirm consent before proceeding.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Survey responses are stored without direct
                identifiers. If contact information is collected for follow-up (e.g., mailing
                lists), it is stored separately from survey data, linked only by an anonymous code
                when necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Right to withdraw:</strong> Participants may stop at any time. Partially
                completed surveys are either excluded from analysis or handled according to pre-registered
                rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Debriefing:</strong> At the end of the survey, participants receive a brief
                explanation of the purpose of the message variations and links to campus resources
                for further civic engagement or support.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Questions about ethics or data use for any future implementation should be directed to

        <!-- TAB: ALTIUS PROTOTYPE -->
        <section
          class="tab-section"
          data-tab="altius"
          aria-label="ALTIUS Prototype Task-Engine Substudy"
        >
          <p class="tab-note">
            This tab describes ALTIUS as a structured substudy: an AI-guided task engine used
            as a civic learning tool and as a source of anonymized behavioral data.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h2>ALTIUS Prototype: Role in the Civic Engagement Experiment</h2>
            <p>
              ALTIUS is an experimental, AI-aligned task engine developed inside the Civic Engagement
              Experiment &amp; Lab. Rather than answering questions in place of the user, ALTIUS is
              designed to reduce inertia and help students move from abstract intention
              (“I should get involved” or “I should write this paper”) toward concrete action. The
              prototype lives at the intersection of civic education, behavioral science, and
              human–AI interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              In research terms, ALTIUS functions as a <em>guided intervention layer</em>. It does
              not replace the campus survey experiment described in the main tab; instead, it
              complements it by generating structured process data on how people actually try to
              solve tasks when they have an AI “co-agent” focused on agency rather than answers.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Core Design Questions</h2>
            <p>
              The ALTIUS substudy is built around questions that parallel the campus experiment but
              operate at the micro level of daily work and civic behavior:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                How does access to an AI task engine that emphasizes small next steps affect
                students’ willingness to start and finish demanding academic or civic tasks?
              </li>
              <li>
                Under what conditions does an AI assistant increase agency (clarity, ownership, follow-through)
                rather than encourage over-dependence or avoidance?
              </li>
              <li>
                Can structured AI prompts be used to surface patterns of procrastination, avoidance,
                and overload that are relevant to democratic engagement (e.g., putting off voting,
                delaying applications, avoiding political discussions)?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Interaction Pattern &amp; Task Engine Logic</h2>
            <p>
              The current prototype runs on a small, repeatable interaction loop:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> The user states a task they are avoiding (e.g., a 5-page paper, a club email, a civic application).</li>
              <li><strong>Decompose:</strong> ALTIUS breaks the task into atomic steps, distinguishing “decision work” from “mechanical work.”</li>
              <li><strong>Anchor:</strong> The system identifies the smallest non-zero action that can be completed immediately (e.g., opening a document, listing songs, drafting one paragraph).</li>
              <li><strong>Execute &amp; Reflect:</strong> The user acts, then reports completion; ALTIUS adjusts the plan, surfaces friction points, and proposes the next move.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Over time, aggregated runs of this loop (with identifiers removed) can be used to
              explore which types of prompts, framing, and structures are most effective at turning
              civic concern and academic pressure into consistent, sustainable action.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Use Cases Within the Civic Lab</h2>
            <p>
              In the broader Civic Lab ecosystem, ALTIUS is envisioned as a tool that can be
              embedded into:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Annotated assignments and civic missions (e.g., mixtape projects, reflection papers, outreach plans).</li>
              <li>
                Workshops on procrastination, burnout, and democratic fatigue, where the agent is
                used live and debriefed as part of the exercise.
              </li>
              <li>
                Longitudinal civic engagement projects, where the same student interacts with ALTIUS
                over multiple tasks and semesters.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each deployment is treated as both a support tool and a mini-experiment, with clear
              consent and opt-out options for users.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Data, Ethics, &amp; Guardrails</h2>
            <p>
              The ALTIUS prototype inherits the same ethical considerations as the main campus
              study, with additional guardrails specific to AI-mediated interaction:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Agency-first design:</strong> The system is explicitly constrained not to
                make decisions for users or to push them toward any partisan outcome. Its role is to
                clarify tasks and suggest next steps, not to prescribe beliefs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data minimization:</strong> Any future research use of ALTIUS logs would rely
                on anonymized, aggregate data (e.g., task categories, completion patterns), not
                identifiable personal narratives.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transparent framing:</strong> Students are informed when an interaction is
                part of a research effort and how their data may be used; participation is optional
                and does not affect grades, standing, or access to services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Non-therapeutic scope:</strong> ALTIUS is not a mental health tool. When
                interactions drift into crisis or clinical issues, the appropriate recommendation is
                to seek campus or professional support, not to “solve it” inside the agent.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In future iterations, formal protocols (e.g., pre-registration, IRB review) would
              govern any systematic comparison between groups that use ALTIUS and those that do not.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Next Steps &amp; Integration</h2>
            <p>
              As the Civic Engagement Experiment grows, ALTIUS is expected to move from a single
              prototype to a family of small, specialized tools. The study details on this page
              provide the quantitative backbone; ALTIUS adds a qualitative and behavioral layer
              focused on how people actually move from understanding civic life to doing something
              about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Future work may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Embedding ALTIUS prompts directly into survey follow-ups and workshop materials.</li>
              <li>Comparing task completion and engagement across different prompt styles.</li>
              <li>
                Connecting insights from ALTIUS back into curriculum design, club training, and
                broader democratic education efforts.
              </li>
