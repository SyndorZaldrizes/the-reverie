          <h2>How do people learn to care about democracy before anyone teaches them how it works?</h2>
          <p>
            This project lives where political science, youth organizing, and web design collide.
            It’s a space to test ideas about civic education, track research on democratic erosion,
            and build tools that make politics less abstract and more human.

            I also built and maintain the website for the St. Mary’s College of Maryland chapter
            of the Maryland Student Legislature. It’s a practical extension of this project:
            students learning how a legislature works by running one.

            <p>
              I’m Nathan Sanchez, a student at St. Mary’s College of Maryland and Delegation
              Chairperson/President of our Maryland Student Legislature chapter. I spend a lot of
              time somewhere between campaign work, legislative simulations, and trying to explain
              dense political structures in plain language.
            </p>
            <p>
              This site is my personal hub for that work: a place to collect research, design
              small civic tools, and document what I’m learning about democratic participation,
              especially for people who are usually treated as an afterthought in politics.

        <h2>Research Project: Democracy & Civic Engagement</h2>
        <p>
          The academic side of this project grows out of coursework, journal memos, and independent
          research on how democracy erodes, who participates in it, and how civic engagement is
          shaped by institutions, inequality, and political culture.

            <h3>Core Questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How do people first learn what “democracy” is supposed to mean in practice?</li>
              <li>What pushes people toward participation versus disengagement?</li>
              <li>
                How do education, media, and lived experience interact when people decide if
                politics is worth their time?

        <h2>Youth & Digital Civic Lab</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of political learning now happens on phones, not in classrooms. This section
          will host work that connects short-form content (like TikToks and clips) to deeper
          explanations on topics such as constitutional rights, state structures, and policy issues.

            <h3>Ideas on the Table</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Short explainers that break the Maryland Constitution into human-sized pieces</li>
              <li>Youth-facing pages that stay bipartisan but center human rights and democracy</li>
              <li>Companion write-ups for videos so teachers, parents, and students can go deeper</li>

            <h3>Future Direction</h3>
            <p>
              Over time, this may become a structured “home base” for youth-oriented civic content:
              a place where media, notes, and interactive tools live together instead of floating
              around as disconnected posts.

          This is the running log: reflections on democracy, civic engagement, campaigns, and what
          it feels like to navigate institutions from the inside. Some of this will be polished
          writing; some will be closer to field notes.
