        <h2>Market &amp; Research Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Before you can build something useful, you have to know who might actually use it and
          why they aren’t already satisfied. This page summarizes the early market research and
          user interviews guiding the Civic Lab’s venture track. It’s less about spreadsheets and
          more about patterns: where the demand is, where the gaps are, and which delusions we had
          to abandon after talking to actual humans.

        <h3>Potential User Segments</h3>
        <p>
          Our initial hypothesis was “everyone who cares about democracy will want this.” Reality
          is more specific. These are the groups who responded with curiosity rather than glazed
          eyes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Student governments &amp; delegations:</strong> Need clear procedures and ways to
              train new members quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Campus clubs &amp; societies:</strong> Want to avoid the “tyranny of the few” and
              spread decision‑making beyond officers.</li>
          <li><strong>Educators &amp; staff:</strong> Looking for pre‑built activities that fit into a
              30‑minute class block without derailing the syllabus.</li>
          <li><strong>Youth programs &amp; after‑school groups:</strong> Crave engaging content that
              doesn’t feel like recycled civics homework.</li>
          <li><strong>Small nonprofits &amp; civic orgs:</strong> Need lightweight tools to run
              deliberative meetings and capture member input without paying enterprise prices.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>What We Learned So Far</h3>
        <p>
          Talking to people (rather than talking to ourselves) produced a few recurring themes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>People are time‑poor.</em> Anything that takes longer than a meeting gets pushed
              aside; prototypes must work in minutes, not hours.</li>
          <li><em>Nobody reads PDFs.</em> Even earnest leaders admitted they rarely read their own
              constitutions; interactive guides beat static documents.</li>
          <li><em>Training is a bottleneck.</em> Clubs reinvent the wheel each year because there’s
              no institutional memory; onboarding tools are valued more than high‑concept theory.</li>
          <li><em>“AI” is a buzzword.</em> Users are intrigued by AI helpers but are wary of
              outsourcing decisions; they want transparency and control.</li>
          <li><em>Cost sensitivity is real.</em> Student orgs and small nonprofits operate on
              shoestring budgets; freemium models or institutional sponsorships are essential.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Competitor Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          The space is a strange mix of polished civic tech platforms and home‑grown Google Docs.
          Our goal isn’t to clone what already exists, but to slot into the gaps. Here’s a rough
          map:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Category</th>
              <th>Examples</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Civic education games</td>
              <td>iCivics, Classroom Democracy kits</td>
              <td>Great for K–12; less helpful for real campus politics</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Governance platforms</td>
              <td>Decidim, Loomio</td>
              <td>Robust but heavy; often require IT support and budgets</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Parliamentary procedure guides</td>
              <td>Robert’s Rules cheat sheets</td>
              <td>Useful reference, but no interactive practice</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>AI productivity tools</td>
              <td>ChatGPT, Notion AI</td>
              <td>General‑purpose; not tailored to civic contexts</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p class="small">
          We respect these tools and occasionally borrow from them. The Civic Lab’s niche is
          somewhere between “teach me how to govern” and “help me actually run this meeting.”

        <h3>Research Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
          The research is ongoing. Upcoming steps include deeper dives into non‑college youth
          programs, pilot deployments on campuses, and partnerships with civic tech providers who
          don’t mind a little experimentation. If you have data, anecdotes or cynical hot takes to
          share, we’d love to hear them.
