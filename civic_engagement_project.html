      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>This research project investigates how universities can cultivate a culture of democratic engagement that reaches all students, including those who feel politically out of place. It builds on work by political scientists who show that civic organizations can mobilize “cross‑pressured” members by emphasizing shared identities, local issues and norms of participation. Our goal is to translate these insights to the campus environment and test whether communications and organizational practices can boost student engagement.</p>
      <p>The project is supported by the <em>Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement Initiative</em> and has been approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Participation is voluntary and confidential.</p>

      <h2>Study Design</h2>
      <p>The study unfolds in two phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pilot study:</strong> An online survey experiment will recruit undergraduate students at our campus. Participants will be randomly assigned to read one of several brief messages about civic engagement and then answer questions about their attitudes, perceptions and intentions. The messages vary in whether they frame engagement in partisan terms, emphasize shared campus identity and local stakes, or highlight norms that most students participate.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling up:</strong> Pending results from the pilot, we plan to partner with multiple universities to implement similar interventions in authentic campus communications (emails, event invitations). We will analyze participation data and survey responses to understand how different environments shape the effectiveness of our messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The pilot will also include faculty and staff surveys to understand instructional practices and perceptions of campus climate. See our <a href="#participate">participation section</a> for details on how to take part.</p>
