        <h2>Prototypes &amp; Tools in Development</h2>
        <p>
          The Civic Lab isn’t just a think‑piece; it’s a workshop. Here you’ll find the drafts,
          mockups and early products that bridge theory to practice. These are deliberately
          messy, opinionated prototypes designed to provoke feedback and reveal what works (and
          what doesn’t) when real people try to use them. None of these are finished; all of them
          are invitations.

        <h3>Blueprint Builder: Constitutions Without Snoozing</h3>
        <p>
          Most student governments and clubs start with a constitution that nobody reads and a set
          of bylaws that nobody understands. The Blueprint Builder is a wizard‑style tool that
          walks you through structure, powers and procedures while forcing you to make choices
          instead of copying boilerplate. It asks awkward questions (“Who can actually call a
          meeting? Why is this threshold ⅔?”) and produces a clear, student‑friendly document at
          the end.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interactive prompts that translate legalese into plain language.</li>
          <li>Real‑time warnings when you create contradictions or concentration of power.</li>
          <li>Export to PDF/Markdown so you can share, edit and adopt it formally.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Decision‑Making Games &amp; Apps</h3>
        <p>
          The analog games on the <a href="civic-lab.html">Civic Lab</a> page are fun, but there’s
          only so much you can do with sticky notes. We’re building lightweight digital tools that
          bring Agenda Jenga, Budget Lab and Parli Pro Speedrun to phones and laptops. They’re not
          meant to replace the real experience; they’re there for when you can’t get everyone in
          the same room or want to run a quick practice round.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drag‑and‑drop agenda setting with timers and auto‑generated debrief questions.</li>
          <li>Budget sliders that visualize trade‑offs and coalition scores in real time.</li>
          <li>A mini parliamentary motion trainer that rewards proper use of procedure like a
              rhythm game.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>ALTIUS Console Integration</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="altius.html">ALTIUS</a> is already live as a public prototype. We’re exploring
          how to embed its catalytic approach into other tools: imagine a meeting planner that
          gently nags you to schedule your first draft agenda or a bylaws builder that throws a
          mild fit when you avoid deciding how to remove officers. The goal is not to let AI run
          your organization; it’s to remove the friction that stops you from doing the obvious
          next step.

        <h3>On the Horizon</h3>
        <p>
          These ideas are simmering on the back burner. They may turn into full products, or they
          may die quietly after testing. Either way, we’re transparent about what we’re thinking:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A micro‑survey engine that lets you poll your members anonymously and visualize
              sentiment without relying on third‑party platforms.</li>
          <li>A “civic mission tracker” that links your club’s activities to the broader research
              questions in this experiment, giving you credit (and data) for what you do.</li>
          <li>Open‑source adapters so educators can plug these tools into existing LMS systems.
          </li>
        </ul>
