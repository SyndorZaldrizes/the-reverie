# Civic Engagement Experiment

A personal research hub and civic design lab by **Nathan Sanchez** exploring democracy,
civic engagement, youth political education, and how people learn to care about
institutions that often feel distant (or broken).

This repository powers a static website hosted via **GitHub Pages**. It sits somewhere
between a personal site, a research notebook, and a lab for building civic-facing tools
(including small interactive demos and game-like learning modules).

## Project Goals

- Document ongoing work on democracy, civic engagement, and political socialization.
- Translate dense theory into public-facing explainers that younger and non-specialist audiences can actually use.
- Prototype small interactive tools, flows, and “serious games” for civic learning.
- Connect academic work, campaign/legislative experience, and digital design in one place.
