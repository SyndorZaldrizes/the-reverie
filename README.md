# Civic Engagement Experiment

A personal research hub and design lab by **Nathan Sanchez** exploring democracy,
civic engagement, youth political education, and how people learn to care about
institutions that often feel distant or broken.

This repository powers a small static website hosted via GitHub Pages. It sits
somewhere between a personal site, a research notebook, and a lab for
experiments in civic-facing web tools.

## Project Goals

- Document ongoing work on democracy, civic engagement, and political
  socialization.
- Build public-facing explainers that translate dense theory into something
  younger and non-specialist audiences can actually use.
- Prototype small interactive tools and flows for civic education.
- Connect academic work, campaign/legislative experience, and digital design in
  one place.

## Site Structure

The site is currently a single-page layout with anchored sections:

- **Hero** – high-level framing of the project.
- **About** – who I am and how this project fits into my broader work.
- **Research Project** – questions and outputs related to democracy and civic engagement.
- **Youth & Digital Civic Lab** – ideas and plans for youth-facing, bipartisan,
  human-rights-and-democracy-first content (e.g., companion pages for short-form video).
- **Experiments** – space for prototypes and interactive tools.
- **Notes & Journal** – intended home for public-facing memos, reflections, and updates.
- **Contact** – basic contact info and links.

## Tech Stack

For now, this project is intentionally simple:

- Static **HTML** (`index.html`)
- A single **CSS** file (`styles.css`)
- Hosted via **GitHub Pages**

This keeps the barrier low while leaving room to grow into a more app-like
experience later (for example, adding JavaScript, API-backed data, or a
progressive web app structure).

## Running Locally

No build tools required.
