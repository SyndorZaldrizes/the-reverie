        <h2>Future Delegates: Learn the Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the youth corner of the Civic Engagement Experiment. Here we break
          down big ideas into small pieces. Whether you’re an elementary school student,
          a curious sibling, or a teacher looking for classroom resources, this page
          offers nonpartisan explanations of how government works—and why it matters.

        <h3>What Does Government Do?</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Government isn’t just a bunch of rules. At its best, it’s a way for a
            community to decide together how to handle shared problems. That includes
            making and enforcing rules, using money (taxes) to provide services like
            schools and parks, and solving challenges like climate change or
            transportation.

        <h3>Maryland’s Constitution</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            The Maryland Constitution is like a rulebook for the rulebook. It tells
            us how the state government works and what rights people have. It also
            reminds us that government exists to serve the people—not the other way
            around. Even if you’re not old enough to vote yet, these rules matter for
            your everyday life.

        <h3>Three Branches of Government</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            To keep one person from having too much power, Maryland (and the U.S.)
            divides government into three branches:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Legislative</strong> – the General Assembly writes and debates laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Executive</strong> – the Governor and agencies carry out the laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Judicial</strong> – courts interpret laws and make sure they’re applied fairly.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

        <h3>How a Bill Becomes a Law (Maryland Edition)</h3>

            <li><strong>Idea:</strong> Someone notices a problem or improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Draft:</strong> A legislator writes a bill.</li>

            <li><strong>Governor:</strong> The Governor signs the bill into law or vetoes it.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="small">
            Students in programs like the Maryland Student Legislature practice a similar
            process to get ready for the real thing.
