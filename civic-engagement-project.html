        <h2>Future Delegates: Learn the Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the youth corner of the Civic Engagement Experiment. Here we break
          down big ideas into small pieces. Whether you’re an elementary school student,
          a curious sibling, or a teacher looking for classroom resources, this page
          offers nonpartisan explanations of how government works — and why it matters.

        <h3>What Does Government Do?</h3>

          <p>
            Government isn’t just a bunch of rules. At its best, it’s a way for a
            community to decide together how to handle shared problems. That includes
            making and enforcing rules, using money (taxes) to provide services like
            schools and parks, and solving challenges like climate change or
            transportation.
