        <h2>Journal Memo &amp; Dissertation Proposal</h2>
        <p>
          This page presents a polished journal memo that lays the groundwork for my senior
          dissertation on democracy and civic engagement. The memo synthesizes key
          literature, proposes a research question, and outlines the methodological
          approach I plan to use. It builds on reading notes and classroom discussions and
          serves as an example of the more formal writing that will live on this site.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Democratic erosion has become one of the defining concerns of contemporary
            political science. While much of the scholarship focuses on institutions,
            leaders, and macro‑level indicators, this memo argues that the roots of
            democratic resilience or decay can be found in the everyday beliefs and
            practices of citizens. Borrowing from Danielle Allen’s emphasis on civic
            friendship and Elizabeth Cohen’s work on democratic deficit, I suggest that
            understanding <em>how</em> people learn about democracy—before and beyond
            formal instruction—is crucial for explaining why some communities defend
            democratic norms while others retreat into cynicism.

        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            The central question of this project is:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>
              How do individuals’ early experiences with political participation and civic
              discourse shape their later commitment to democratic norms?
            </strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In other words, can we trace a link between the way young people encounter
            politics—through school, family conversations, social media, or organizing—and
            their willingness to defend or abandon democratic procedures when those
            procedures are threatened?
          </p>

        <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            This memo draws on a range of theoretical traditions. From normative
            democratic theory, it incorporates Hannah Arendt’s insistence that politics
            should be a space of public freedom rather than private satisfaction.
            From empirical studies, it engages with research on political socialization
            and civic education, particularly work showing that early political
            discussions at home and in classrooms have long‑term effects on participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Critical perspectives like those of Charles Mills remind us that not
            everyone is invited into the democratic conversation, and that what counts
            as “participation” is shaped by race, class, and gender. This proposal
            therefore situates individual learning within broader structures of power.

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            I propose a mixed‑methods study that combines qualitative interviews with
            quantitative survey data. Semi‑structured interviews will be conducted
            with college students who have participated in legislative simulations
            (like the Maryland Student Legislature) and those who have not. Surveys
            will measure participants’ political efficacy, tolerance for dissent, and
            understanding of democratic procedures. The goal is to see whether early
            exposure to democratic practices (beyond voting) correlates with stronger
            commitments to norms like fair play and peaceful turnover of power.

        <h3>Expected Contributions</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            This project aims to contribute to both democratic theory and civic
            education practice. Theoretically, it bridges micro‑level socialization
            research with macro‑level democratic erosion debates. Practically, it
            offers insight into how educators and organizers might foster more durable
            democratic commitments by designing experiences that model inclusive,
            deliberative politics at an early age.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Democracy is not self‑sustaining. It relies on people who have learned to
            see themselves as part of a collective project, capable of both speaking up
            and listening. By exploring the pathways through which individuals come to
            value democratic norms, this research seeks to illuminate how that
            commitment can be renewed in an era of polarization and disinformation.
